# This file makes the agents directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import specific classes or submodules here
# to make them available when the package is imported.
# For example:
# from .hypothesis_generator import HypothesisGenerator
# from .xolver_scientific_agents import ScientificAgent, HypothesisGeneratorAgent

# For now, keeping it simple. Users can import directly from the submodules.
