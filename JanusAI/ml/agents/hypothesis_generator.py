# Note: The `ScientificAgent` in `xolver_scientific_agents.py` takes `model: torch.nn.Module`.
# The provided snippet for `HypothesisGenerator` does not explicitly show model usage in its new methods.
# If a model is required by the base class, it must be provided.
# The `super().__init__` call has been updated to pass the model.
# If this agent does not use a PyTorch model, the base class or this class might need adjustment.

# Further, the base `ScientificAgent.generate` takes `shared_memory: List[Dict[str, Any]]`.
# The new `HypothesisGenerator.generate` takes `shared_memory: SharedMemory`.
# This type mismatch needs to be resolved. For now, I've used `SharedMemory` type.
# This might require an adapter or change in the base class if strict type hinting is enforced elsewhere.
# The `memory.dual_memory_system.SharedMemory` has a `get_top(k=1)` method which returns a list of `IntermediateResult`.
# `IntermediateResult` has an `expression` attribute.

# The `EpisodicMemory` type is also not defined here. I've used `Any`.
# The `_extract_patterns` method would need to know how to interact with the actual `EpisodicMemory` object.
# `EpisodicMemory` from `memory.dual_memory_system` has `get_top_validated`.
# The `Discovery` object in `EpisodicMemory` has an `expression` attribute.
