# Modern Development Environment Setup Summary

## üöÄ What We've Set Up

We've established a comprehensive modern development environment for the Janus project with the following components:

### 1. **Project Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)**
- Single source of truth for all project metadata and dependencies
- Organized dependency groups (dev, viz, ml, distributed, tracking, gpu)
- Integrated tool configurations (Black, Ruff, MyPy, pytest, coverage)
- Modern Python packaging standards (PEP 517/518)

### 2. **Code Quality Tools**

#### **Black** - Uncompromising Code Formatter
- Consistent code style across the entire project
- Zero configuration needed (opinionated formatter)
- Line length: 100 characters
- Integrated with VS Code and pre-commit

#### **Ruff** - Ultra-Fast Python Linter
- Replaces multiple tools (Flake8, isort, pydocstyle, etc.)
- 10-100x faster than traditional linters
- Comprehensive rule set with smart defaults
- Auto-fixes many issues

### 3. **Pre-commit Hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)**
Automated checks before every commit:
- Code formatting (Black)
- Linting (Ruff)
- Import sorting
- Security scanning (Bandit)
- Type checking (MyPy)
- File cleanup (trailing whitespace, EOF fixes)
- YAML/JSON validation
- Custom project-specific checks

### 4. **Development Workflow (`Makefile`)**
Simple commands for common tasks:
```bash
make setup         # One-time setup
make format        # Format all code
make lint          # Run linters
make test          # Run tests
make check         # Run all checks
make docs          # Build documentation
```

### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)**
Automated GitHub Actions for:
- Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Multi-Python version testing (3.8-3.11)
- Code quality checks
- Documentation building
- Security scanning
- Test coverage reporting

### 6. **IDE Integration**
- **VS Code**: Full configuration with recommended extensions
- **PyCharm**: Compatible with all tools
- **EditorConfig**: Consistent formatting across all editors

## üìã Quick Start Guide

### Initial Setup (One Time)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/janus.git
cd janus

# Run the setup script
python scripts/setup_dev_env.py

# Or manually:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Before starting work
git pull origin main
make install-dev  # Update dependencies if needed

# While developing
make format       # Format your code
make test-fast    # Run quick tests
make check-fast   # Quick quality check

# Before committing
make check        # Full check (auto-runs on commit anyway)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Benefits of This Setup

1. **Consistency**: Every developer's code looks the same
2. **Quality**: Issues caught before they reach the repository
3. **Speed**: Ruff is incredibly fast, no waiting for linters
4. **Automation**: Pre-commit handles everything automatically
5. **Modern**: Using the latest Python packaging standards
6. **Comprehensive**: Covers formatting, linting, testing, security
7. **Flexible**: Easy to add or modify tools as needed

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Dependencies
Edit `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "new-package>=1.0.0",  # Core dependency
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
ml = [
    "new-ml-package>=2.0.0",  # Optional ML dependency
]
```

### Modifying Tool Settings
All tool configurations are in `pyproject.toml`:
- `[tool.black]` - Black formatter settings
- `[tool.ruff]` - Ruff linter settings
- `[tool.mypy]` - Type checker settings
- `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` - Test runner settings

### Updating Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Update to latest versions
pre-commit autoupdate

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

- [Pre-commit Documentation](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [Python Packaging Guide](https://packaging.python.org/)

## ü§ù Contributing

With this setup, contributing is easy:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Write code (formatting/linting handled automatically)
4. Run tests (`make test`)
5. Commit (pre-commit runs automatically)
6. Push and create a PR

The CI pipeline will verify everything automatically!

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Enable branch protection**: Require CI checks to pass before merging
2. **Set up code coverage**: Track test coverage over time
3. **Add documentation**: Set up Sphinx for API documentation
4. **Configure releases**: Automated versioning and changelog generation
5. **Add performance benchmarks**: Track performance regressions

This modern development environment ensures that the Janus project maintains high code quality standards while making development smooth and enjoyable for all contributors.
