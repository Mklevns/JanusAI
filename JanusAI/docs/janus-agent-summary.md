# DiscoveryAgent Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented the complete `DiscoveryAgent` class along with its neural communication components for the JanusAI multi-agent system. This implementation follows the tiered communication architecture and includes the Augmented Consensus with LLM feedback pattern.

## Key Components

### 1. **CommunicationEncoder** 
A neural network that encodes high-dimensional agent states into 32-dimensional latent vectors:

```python
encoder = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim),
    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim),
    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, latent_dim),
    nn.Tanh()  # Normalize to [-1, 1]
)
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Added layer normalization for training stability
- Two hidden layers for sufficient expressiveness
- Tanh activation to bound outputs to [-1, 1]
- Xavier initialization for weights

### 2. **CommunicationAggregator**
An attention mechanism that aggregates incoming communication vectors:

```python
def forward(self, own_state, comm_vectors):
    # Multi-head attention
    query = self.query_proj(own_state)
    keys = self.key_proj(comm_stack)
    values = self.value_proj(comm_stack)
    
    # Scaled dot-product attention
    scores = torch.matmul(query, keys.T) / sqrt(head_dim)
    weights = softmax(scores)
    attended = torch.matmul(weights, values)
    
    # Residual connection
    output = layer_norm(output + own_state)
```

**Design Decisions:**
- Multi-head attention (4 heads) for richer representations
- Residual connections for gradient flow
- Layer normalization for stability
- Returns zero vector when no communications received

### 3. **DiscoveryAgent**
The main agent class with role-based behavior and phased communication:

#### **Key Features:**

**A. Training Phases:**
- **Phase 1**: No communication (individual competence)
- **Phase 2**: Tactical communication enabled (Tier 2)
- **Phase 3**: Strategic communication enabled (Tier 1 with cost)

**B. Role-Based Behavior:**
```python
exploration_rates = {
    AgentRole.EXPLORER: 0.3,     # High exploration
    AgentRole.REFINER: 0.1,      # Focused improvement
    AgentRole.VALIDATOR: 0.05,   # Minimal exploration
    AgentRole.SPECIALIST: 0.2    # Domain-specific
}
```

**C. Strategic Discovery Publishing:**
The `_should_publish_discovery()` method implements cost-aware decision making:
- Checks if reward justifies the tier1_cost (0.1)
- Compares against best known discoveries
- Uses role-specific thresholds
- Validators don't publish discoveries

**D. Augmented Consensus Validation:**
The `_handle_validation_request()` method implements the recommended pattern:

1. **Primary Evidence - Empirical Validation:**
   - Re-evaluates discovery performance
   - Applies complexity penalty (Occam's Razor)
   - Most important factor (70% weight)

2. **LLM Consultation for Ambiguous Cases:**
   - Only consulted when empirical score is ambiguous (Â±0.15 from 0.5)
   - Treated as peer reviewer, not oracle
   - 30% weight when used

3. **Weighted Decision:**
   ```python
   if ambiguous:
       final_score = 0.7 * empirical_score + 0.3 * llm_similarity
   else:
       final_score = empirical_score
   approve = final_score > 0.6
   ```

### 4. **Integration Points**

**Message Processing:**
```python
for msg in incoming_messages:
    if msg.msg_type == MessageType.TACTICAL_VECTOR and phase >= 2:
        tactical_vectors.append(msg.content)
    elif msg.msg_type == MessageType.VALIDATION_REQUEST and role == VALIDATOR:
        self._handle_validation_request(msg)
```

**Communication Generation:**
- Phase 2+: Generates tactical vectors via encoder
- Phase 3+: Can propose discoveries to SharedKnowledgeBase

**Memory Integration:**
- All discoveries added to local DualMemorySystem
- High-reward discoveries promoted to long-term memory

## Usage Example

```python
# Create agent
agent = DiscoveryAgent(
    agent_id="explorer_001",
    role=AgentRole.EXPLORER,
    policy_network=my_policy,
    environment=my_env,
    memory_system=DualMemorySystem([],[]),
    shared_knowledge=shared_kb
)

# Set training phase
agent.set_training_phase(3)  # Full communication

# Explore with incoming messages
messages = message_bus.get_messages("explorer_001")
discovery, comm_vector = agent.explore(messages)

# Check statistics
stats = agent.get_stats()
# {'discoveries': 5, 'tier1_sent': 2, 'tier2_sent': 10, 'validations': 0}
```

## Design Highlights

1. **Phased Learning**: Agents gradually learn to communicate, preventing early convergence to poor protocols

2. **Cost-Aware Communication**: Tier 1 messages have explicit cost, encouraging selective use

3. **Empirical-First Validation**: LLM is only consulted for genuinely ambiguous cases

4. **Role Specialization**: Different behaviors and thresholds based on agent role

5. **Attention-Based Aggregation**: Agents can selectively attend to relevant peer communications

6. **Thread-Safe Integration**: Works seamlessly with the thread-safe MessageBus and SharedKnowledgeBase

## Extension Points

1. **LLM Integration**: The `_consult_llm()` method is a placeholder ready for real LLM client integration

2. **Policy Network**: The policy interface is generic and can work with any PyTorch model

3. **Environment**: Works with any Gym-like environment interface

4. **Memory System**: The DualMemorySystem can be extended with more sophisticated retrieval

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-agent scientific discovery with neural communication and intelligent validation.
