# JanusAI
Janus is a Python framework for automated scientific discovery in physics and AI interpretability. It empowers AI to find symbolic laws governing phenomena and to interpret other AI models' internal workings symbolically. Named after the Roman god of transitions, Janus reflects its dual focus: uncovering past laws and understanding future AI
