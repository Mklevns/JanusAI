Janus: A Framework for Automated Scientific Discovery and AI InterpretabilityIntroductionJanus is a Python framework for automated scientific discovery in physics and AI interpretability. It empowers AI to find symbolic laws governing phenomena and to interpret other AI models' internal workings symbolically. Named after the Roman god of transitions, Janus reflects its dual focus: uncovering past laws and understanding future AI mechanisms.Core Vision and MissionThe central mission of Janus is to:Automate Scientific Discovery: Develop robust algorithms for autonomously discovering symbolic physical laws from observational data.Enhance AI Interpretability: Provide tools for AI models to extract human-understandable symbolic explanations from complex "black-box" models.Facilitate Meta-Learning: Implement strategies for AI agents to learn how to learn or discover across various scientific tasks.Promote Rigor and Reproducibility: Offer a structured and testable environment for AI in science research.Key Challenges AddressedJanus tackles fundamental challenges, including:Symbolic Regression: Finding precise, interpretable mathematical formulas.Data Generation: Creating physically accurate and diverse datasets.Interpretability of Deep Learning: Bridging the gap between opaque neural networks and clear explanations.Generalization Across Tasks: Training models that adapt to new scientific scenarios.Scalability: Designing architectures for complex models and large datasets.Architectural OverviewThe Janus framework is structured into interconnected modules:janus/core/: Defines expressions and grammar rules.janus/environments/: Provides various environments for physics and AI interpretation.janus/physics/: Contains laws, data generation, validation, and discovery algorithms.janus/ml/: Implements neural networks, reward functions, and training paradigms.janus/ai_interpretability/: Offers tools for symbolic AI interpretation, including grammars, interpreters, and evaluation metrics.janus/experiments/: Manages experiment configurations, execution runners, and analysis.janus/integration/: Integrates components into cohesive pipelines.janus/cli/: Provides a command-line interface.janus/config/: Handles configuration loading and management.janus/utils/: General utilities for I/O, logging, math, visualization, and error handling.Key Features and CapabilitiesPhysics Law DiscoverySymbolic AI InterpretabilityReinforcement Learning for DiscoveryMeta-Learning for GeneralizationConfigurable ExperimentsDistributed Training SupportComprehensive EvaluationModular and Extensible DesignTarget Audience and Use CasesJanus is for AI/Physics researchers, ML engineers, students, and educators.
